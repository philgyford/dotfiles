dotfiles
========

My system config stuff.

For each of the files/folders do something like:

    $ ln -s ~/Projects/personal/dotfiles/filename ~/.filename

For .atom you'll also need to install the packages too. Assuming I've
been methodically starring packages I've installed on http://atom.io, then I
can do:

	$ apm stars --install

to install all starred packages.
