dotfiles
========

My system config stuff.

For each of the files/folders do something like:

    $ ln -s ~/Projects/personal/dotfiles/filename ~/.filename

For Atom, you should also install the "package-sync" Package, which will read
your `.atom/packages.cson` file and install the necessary Packages.
